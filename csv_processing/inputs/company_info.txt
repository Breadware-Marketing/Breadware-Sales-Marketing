Key athletes include Dustin Johnson, Rory McIlroy, Jason Day, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm and Tiger Woods.\n\nHistory:\nIn the spring of 1979 a golf equipment salesman named Gary Adams took out a $24,000 loan on his home and founded the TaylorMade Golf Company. He rented a 6,000 square-foot building that at one time housed a television assembly plant. Counting him, there were three employees and a single, innovative product: a 12-degree driver cast of stainless steel. This new metalwood looked and sounded different from a wooden wood, and most important, it performed differently. The clubhead's perimeter-weighting offered greater forgiveness on mis-hits, while the lower center of gravity made it easier to launch the ball in the air. Adams, the son of a golf professional, was adamant that TaylorMade clubs maintain ties to what true golfers perceived an authentic golf club should look and feel like. They were committed to combining innovation with authenticity, to always be passionate about the game, and pledged to be competitive - to work hard to establish itself and grow. These four tenets would take them far."},

Monoprice's formula is simple, we eliminate the high costs of fancy packaging and middlemen while leveraging economies of scale by purchasing in large volumes. You, as a customer, are only paying only for the materials and workmanship of the cables and accessories. We go further to ensure customer satisfaction by pricing our products as closely as possible to the wholesale cost.Another simple way to look at it is this; with regards to cables for example, though the cost of commodities such as copper, silicon, plastics and labor maybe high, in a high volume production would the cost of each component that goes into the manufacture of a cable really add up to the price you paid at the retail store? In other words, does the sum of its parts add up to what you paid for that 6 foot cable? Chances are, if you bought it from somewhere else, it does not. The fair price is what you'll find on our site.Because we remain highly focused on customer satisfaction, we like to think of Monoprice.com as a service rather than a store. Please don't forget to check our resellerratings.com customer ratings and reviews. If you haven't yet purchased online, this is the best way to start!!"},

We hold family values in the highest regard, demonstrating integrity, fairness and honesty in our relationships with customers, employees, vendors and suppliers.The first Fareway Store opened for business at 624 Story Street in Boone, Iowa, on May 12, 1938. Our first ad featured coffee at 14 cents a pound and a \"regular package\"​ of Wheaties for 10 cents. Even then, our commitment to only selling USDA Choice beef cuts was evident, with offerings of USDA Choice Sirloin or T-bone steaks for 25 cents a pound.Fareway's reputation for having the best quality meats (at the best prices, we might add) stems directly from our founder, Paul S. Beckwith, who was a meat supervisor at another grocery chain before starting Fareway. His determination to offer the highest quality meats, even when opting for lesser cuts would have meant more profit, still guides everything we do.Today, Fareway is one of the largest employers in Iowa. We opened our 100th store in 2011 and have recently expanded to other Midwestern states including Illinois, Minnesota and Nebraska, with more store openings on the way."},

Or save time and order ahead online at www.gigiscupcakesusa.com.  ABOUT OUR FOUNDER Gigi moved to Nashville in 1994 from California to pursue a career in music. At 15 years old, Gigi started Gigi’s Cleaning Company and continued that business once she arrived in Nashville. For fourteen years, Gigi supported her dream by cleaning houses during the day and singing late nights at the honky tonks on Broadway. While she loved music, she also had a passion for the culinary arts and baking. As years went by, she decided to take a chance on baking. She took a huge risk by opening a cupcake boutique in a high rent area just off of Music Row on Broadway in Nashville, TN on February 21, 2008 – not far from the bars she sang at. Gigi recalls the stress she was under with only $33 left in her bank account the day she opened the store. She had risked it all on an idea and she held her breath, hoping customers would love her creations. That month Gigi was able to sell enough cupcakes to pay all of her bills, including her $4,000 rent, and still bring home a small profit. Each day the stores lines grew longer and longer and Gigi knew she was onto to something with her homemade creations. Six years later Gigi’s Cupcakes has grown to become the nation’s largest cupcake franchise. There are currently 95 Gigi’s Cupcakes locations in over 23 states with strong growth continuing."},

He not only inherited lands from his family, however, but also a great love for plants. Following the example of his mother, who had already tried her hand at the experimental cultivation of yerba mate, Don Victor and his wife María Silvia developed the first successful yerba mate plantation on lands formerly used for cattle breeding. It was 1924. They were young and had dreams for the future.Years later, the idea of planting black tea changed the landscape of the region forever, and three generations with the same strive as the founder have worked in this family project and made it what it is today: a top quality company. At present, Las Marías produces FIRST RATE black tea, and it is the leading yerba mate producer in the world, with a variety of brands such as Taragüi, Unión, La Merced and Mañanita.

Born with humble beginnings in a 700-square foot building in Mahomet, Illinois, PSE was one of the first five companies to obtain licensing under the Allen Patent for compound bows. Of the original five, PSE is the only company still manufacturing compound bows.In 1982, PSE moved its entire operation - employees and all - to Tucson, Arizona, incorporaing the manufacturing and production in one location. As a sharp contrast to the modest 700 square foot original location, PSE's corporate offices, factory, and pro shop facilities practically fill an entire city block in central Tucson.Archers can count on PSE to bring advanced manufacturing techniques to the industry. PSE was one of the first companies to machine bow risers and accessories from solid aluminum. PSE pioneered the four stage forging process for bow risers to create strong, lightweight bows.PSE, as the industry's leading manufacturer, holds twenty patents for bow design and archery products. These improvements spread throughout the industry to everyone's benefit, not just PSE. \"Research and development are the most expensive stages in manufacturing,\" Pete Shepley explains, \"but we're committed to it and to making the whole industry grow, not just our slice of the pie.\""},

This eliminated the inconsistency and the standardized GYROKONES(TM) led the way to the success and popularity of the Gyros sandwich.\n\nWith these two inventions, the Kronos GYROKONES and the KRONOMATIC Broiler, Chris Tomaras opened doors of culinary opportunity to restaurant owners and Greek-hungry patrons alike. This proved to be the foundation of Kronos Foods, Inc.\n\nEqually significant was the development of many forms of portion controlled meat such as the GYROS LOAVES and pre-cooked GYROS SLICES, GYROS PORTIONS, the I.Q.F. GYROS STRIPS as well as a variety of specialty items, entrées, appetizers and pastries.\n\nIn 1980, Kronos expanded its operations by manufacturing its own Pita Bread and Tzatziki sauce. And so arose the Bakery and Dairy divisions of Kronos, in which several types of Pita Breads as well as Tzatziki sauce are made. In 1999, Kronos further expanded its operations by installing a new, state-of-the-art Pita line capable of producing 50,000 pieces per hour.

The Hoyt family was responsible for innovating more new archery ideas than anyone in their era, and that trend continues today. \n\nSince the sport of archery's return to the Olympics in 1972 where Hoyt bows won both men and women’s gold and ignited Hoyt’s dominance on the Olympic stage, more medals have been won with Hoyt bows than all other bow manufacturers combined. \n\nFrom its humble beginning in a small workshop in St. Louis, Missouri, to today’s world-class, 150,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City, Utah, Hoyt has been the world’s premier bowmaker. Just as in the past, today every Hoyt bow features a long list of technologies and innovations. We know that serious bowhunters and archers are different and demand equipment that will allow them to perform at the highest level whether in the woods or on the tournament line. No gimmicks. No shortcuts. Simply the best we know how to make.\n\nThe same principles and philosophies that the Hoyt Archery Company were founded on in 1931 flow stronger than ever through the company today. Hoyt’s nearly nine decades of industry-leading products and long-term stability is a testament to the commitment, dedication and passion of its employees. And as we look to the future, we’ll remain 100% committed to building the most innovative and technically advanced equipment for the most serious archers and bowhunters across the globe.

Mr. Chrisman had noticed urethane bowling balls (a relatively new innovation in ball design) were porous and tended to soak the oil from the bowling lanes. The new product was marketed as U Clean / U Score Urethane Bowling Ball Cleaner™.High Score Products remained a one product company until 1991, when availability of capital and time coincided with the opportunity to manufacture bowling balls. Mr. Chrisman's experience in other industries and his long term involvement with bowling led him to believe that small quantity OEM private label manufacturing was a viable market being completely ignored by large manufactures. In the spring of 1991, Mr. Chrisman hired Keith Orton, a pioneer in manufacturing high performance urethane bowling balls, to set up a facility to manufacture bowling balls for High Score Products.The first balls were produced in August 1991 and the process of an appropriate trade name for a HSP bowling ball was begun. After several weeks of effort the STORM® name was chosen. The name offered a number of possibilities for strong graphic presentation as well as the kind of strong power image traditionally associated with bowling balls and other sports equipment. The name was also thought to have a universal quality, which would cut across cultural lines and be effective in both domestic and foreign markets.PURPOSE - TO GROW THE SPORT OF BOWLINGStorm must not only hold to the highest standards of innovation, quality workmanship, and performance of its products, we must also strive to grow the sport of bowling. We must create enthusiasts! Our purpose is to continue to inspire existing bowlers and to foster and develop new bowlers. We must continue to educate pro shops on Industry best-practices to properly service their customers to insure all who choose our equipment have the best chance at positive experiences."},

He quickly noted the dislike most establishments had for frozen drinks.  This dislike stemmed from the complicated mixing process that slowed down customer service.  Also, while customers wanted frozen drinks, the operators were not marketing them properly.  The drinks that were available were of inferior quality, limited selection and premium priced.  Based on a vision to revolutionize the way frozen drinks were treated in the market place, David Briggs began an extensive research effort focused on developing a variety of high quality frozen drink products that could be prepared in a consistent manner. Prepared with the development of more than 20 unique frozen drink offerings (primarily alcoholic), Briggs introduced the frozen specialty drink concept in the New Orleans area on January 2, 1983, known as New Orleans Original Daiquiris.  This concept focuses on the sale of frozen specialty drinks at locations that provide a casual, conversational atmosphere, are well lighted, clean and appeal to a broad clientele base."},

One day, at the suggestion of Albert’s wife, Ruth, they tried canning menudo, a popular Mexican stew. This innovative side venture, started in 1950, grew to become a huge success, eventually leading Juanita’s to be the world’s largest manufacturer of canned menudo.Shortly after son George Jr. took the helm of the family business in 1968, he decided to completely eliminate the fish canning, focusing on the true heart of the company: authentic, ready-to-serve home cooked Mexican food. The company’s product line expanded in 1977 when they acquired the Pico Pica Sauce brand. By 1986, the company’s path was clear, and was officially renamed Juanita’s Foods, emphasizing their commitment to maintaining their well-earned title of leader in the Mexican food category.Today, Juanita’s continues their passion for innovation while maintaining their dedication to authentic, high-quality Mexican food. Their product line continues to grow with a wide variety of flavorful soups, sauces and stews under the direction of George Jr.’s son, Aaron as CEO.

It was driven unseen by an urge to communicate with people, to find our diasporidic tribe, and to connect with other souls adrift on a culture that had lost its center and spun its inhabitants to the four winds to wander lost and bereft with a longing to re-enter the light. Beer, we have learned, has always been a good lubricant for social intercourse!\n\nThe Lagunitas Brewing Co. was not so much an act of ordinary ‘foundling’ as it was willed into being by the unspoken desire of supportive beer-lovers in Northern California after which they continued to nurture their creation and urged us forward to fulfill the unifying needs of that same beer-loving diaspora from coast to coast and beyond.
